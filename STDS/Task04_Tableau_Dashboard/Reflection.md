# Reflection on Task 04: Tableau Dashboard Development

This task focused on the design and implementation of an interactive dashboard using Tableau. The core data source for this project was employee information (`Employee.csv`), which was used to create various visualizations exploring aspects such as employee demographics, departmental distribution, and performance metrics. The Tableau dashboard (`Dashboard.twb`) provides a user-friendly interface for stakeholders to explore employee data, identify trends, and gain actionable insights into the workforce.
