# Reflection on Task 02: AdventureWorks Power BI Analysis

This project centered on developing a Power BI dashboard for the AdventureWorks dataset. The task involved integrating various data sources, including SQL queries (from `Sql_Task.sql`) and CSV files (`SalesTerritory.csv`, `SalesView.csv`), to build a comprehensive data model. The Power BI dashboard aims to provide interactive visualizations and reports on sales performance, customer data, and geographical territories within the AdventureWorks business scenario, enabling data-driven decision-making.
