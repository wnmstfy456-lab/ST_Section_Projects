# Reflection on Task 01: Excel Analysis

This task involved comprehensive data analysis using Excel. The primary focus was on two distinct datasets: HR data and food-related sales data. The HR data analysis aimed at extracting insights into employee demographics, performance, and other relevant metrics, while the food analysis focused on understanding sales patterns, inventory, or consumption trends. Both tasks leveraged Excel's robust features for data manipulation, formula application, and basic visualization to draw meaningful conclusions.
