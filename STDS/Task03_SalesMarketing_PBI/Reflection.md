# Reflection on Task 03: Sales and Marketing Power BI Dashboard

The objective of this task was to create a dynamic Power BI dashboard for Sales and Marketing analysis. The project utilized multiple data inputs, including product and shipping method CSVs (`Product.csv`, `ShipMethod.csv`), alongside pre-generated visual insights in PNG format (`customer_analysis.png`, `executive_summary.png`, `marketing_conversion.png`, `sales_product_analysis.png`) and geographical data (`map_json_countries.json`). The dashboard visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) related to sales trends, marketing campaign effectiveness, and customer behavior to support strategic business initiatives.
